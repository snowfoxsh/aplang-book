# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation process, here are a few troubleshooting tips:

- **Command not found**: If you see a "command not found" error when running `cargo` or `aplang`, ensure that your terminalâ€™s `PATH` environment variable includes the directory where Cargo installs binaries. This is usually `$HOME/.cargo/bin` on Unix-like systems or `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows. You may need to add this directory to your `PATH` manually.
  
- **Rust or Cargo not installed**: If Cargo is not installed, double-check that you followed the installation steps correctly. Make sure you have a stable internet connection and that you followed all prompts during installation.

- **Permissions issues**: If you encounter permissions issues, try running the command with `sudo` (on Unix-like systems) or as an administrator (on Windows). However, be cautious with using `sudo` and only use it when necessary.
