# README  
This is the introduction to ApLang, a tool designed to help you excel in your AP Computer Science Principles class and achieve higher scores on your AP test. ApLang follows an extended version of the [AP-CSP Spec](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-exam-reference-sheet.pdf).  

In the early days of computing, manuals were essential tools, guiding users through every step to unlock their computer's potential. Think of this guide as your modern equivalentâ€”a comprehensive resource to help you learn and use ApLang.

This guide is not meant to replace your teacher but to complement your learning, serving as both an introduction to ApLang and a reliable reference as you develop your programming skills.  

## Standard Library Documentation  
Inside, you'll find detailed documentation for the ApLang standard library. Each module and function is carefully explained to help you understand its purpose and how to use it effectively.  

## About ApLang  
ApLang was built using the Rust programming language, chosen for its exceptional performance, portability via LLVM, and its developer-friendly package manager, Cargo. As an interpreted language, ApLang allows you to write and execute code without a compilation step, ensuring it remains accessible and easy to use for learners of all levels. It prioritizes error handling over speed to provide you with the best feedback possible.
