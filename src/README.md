# README
this is the intro to the language. explain why it exists and stuff. 

The point of this guide is not to be your teacher but to get you aquatinted with ApLang and for you to use as a refineries when you are programming. It assumes you have some very basic knowlage of programming but are a beginner. Back in the ancient days, during the dawn of personal computing your computer would come with manual which was super absolutely indispensable. It was difficult to do stuff without your manual. Let this book be your modern manual.

## About

ApLang was itself written using the programming language [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Rust was chosen as a host primarily because of its ability to "run anywhere" (thanks LLVM <3) and its awesome package manager Cargo. ApLang is an interpreted language meaning that it is executed without compiling first. I want this project to be accessable to as many people as possible
