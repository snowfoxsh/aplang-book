# README

This is the introduction to ApLang, a tool designed to help you excel in your AP Computer Science Principles class and score higher on your AP test.

The purpose of this guide is not to replace your teacher but to get you acquainted with ApLang and serve as a reference while you are programming. It assumes you have some very basic knowledge of programming but are still a beginner.

Back in the early days of personal computing, computers often came with a manual that was absolutely indispensable. It was difficult to accomplish much without that manual. Let this guide be your modern equivalentâ€”your go-to resource for learning ApLang. 

Some of ApLangs syntax is garbage. womp womp. Sorry about that...I did not design it. It was designed lovingly by committee by the Collage Board. 

## Standard Library Documentation

This book also contains the documentation for the standard library. Documentation explains how each standard library module's functions work. 
## About

ApLang was created using the programming language [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). Rust was chosen primarily for its ability to "run anywhere" (thanks to LLVM <3) and its excellent package manager, Cargo. ApLang is an interpreted language, meaning it is executed without being compiled first, making it easy to use and accessible to as many people as possible.
