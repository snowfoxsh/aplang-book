# Basics

Congratulations! You have successfully installed ApLang and configured your development environment! If you haven't done that yet, please see the [Installation](installation.md) section.

Introducing the `.ap` file! For legal reasons, `.ap` doesn't stand for Advanced Placement; it stands for something else... uh... Apple Pie! Yep! 

> **Disclaimer:** The term ".ap" is a proprietary file extension of ApLang, hereinafter referred to as "Apple Pie." Any resemblance to actual file extensions, past or present, is purely coincidental. By using the ".ap" file extension, you agree to bake, metaphorically or otherwise, a delicious apple pie, and hereby release ApLang and all affiliates from any claims, demands, or disputes arising from or in connection with your pie-making activities. All rights reserved. Terms and conditions apply. Batteries not included. Consult your local baker for details.

The `main.ap` file is where you place your code. If you have not created it yet please do so now. It does not have to be called `main.ap` but that is the conventional name. It must end with a `.ap` file extension. When you are ready to run your code, you will call the interpreter that you just installed. Run the following command in your console to execute your code:

```bash
aplang main.ap
```

`aplang` will then execute your file. Watch your console for any output your code may produce.
